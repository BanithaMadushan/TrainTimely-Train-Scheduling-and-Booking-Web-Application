# TrainTimely-Train-Scheduling-and-Booking-Web-Application
TrainTimely is a web-based train scheduling and booking system built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. This group project includes features like user authentication, interactive train schedules, and booking management. I contributed by developing the login, signup, and several frontend pages.
